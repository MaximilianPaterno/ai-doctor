# ðŸš€ AI Doctor â€“ Startup Guide

This guide walks you through all steps needed to run your AI Doctor project locally. It includes launching the backend, Ollama, and the iOS frontend app.

---

## ðŸ§  Prerequisites

- Node.js installed  
- Ollama installed and running  
- Swift/Xcode set up (for iOS build)  
- DeepSeek model pulled locally via Ollama

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step Checklist

---

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal window and run:

cd ~/Desktop/ai-doctor/backend/ai-doctor-server  
node server.js

âœ… You should see:  
Server listening on http://localhost:3000

---

### 2. Start the Ollama Service

In a separate terminal window:

ollama serve

Optional check:  
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/  
Response should include "Ollama is running"

---

### 3. Ensure the DeepSeek Model is Pulled

ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b

Pull this only once â€” it ensures the model is available.

---

### 4. Test the Backend Endpoint

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ask \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userMessage":"I have a mild headache, what should I do?"}'

âœ… You should receive a response from the model via your backend.

---

### 5. Run the iOS App

1. Open Xcode:  
   ~/Desktop/ai-doctor/frontend/AIDoctorPilot.xcodeproj

2. Press Cmd + R or click Run to build and launch the simulator.

3. Use the UI to ask questions and receive real-time model responses via your local backend.

---

âœ… Youâ€™re up and running!
